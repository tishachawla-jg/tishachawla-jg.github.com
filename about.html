                    <h1>Hi,thanks for visiting my site.</h1>
        
<p>I embrace the idea that time unfolds us rather than changing us. All our trials,tribulations, setbacks, and successes give a deep insight into our inner strengths and capabilities. Similar to the famous saying, “the universe unfolds as it should,” I find
my life similar to a plot by a famous writer with me as its protagonist trying to fit into the role.
    I graduated from  Loreto Convent ,one of the most prestigious schools in the city.The rules and regulations there being quite similar to that we have in  VIT. I have been among the top scorers in my school and got 98.5% in my boards. My passion for  STEM disciplines  encouraged me to pursue Computer Engineering as my major.Apart from my fondness for technology, I have an artistic temperament.I have  performed numerous classical dance shows across the city.Dance gave me discipline and confidence required to succeed in life.I was associated with the literary and dramatics club of my school and participated actively in the Model United Nations.I managed and organised Cultural house events like  debates , quizzes and chess competitions.</p>
